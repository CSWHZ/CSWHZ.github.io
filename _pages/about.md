Hi, my name is Hanzhang Wang (王含章), and I am currently studying at the School of Science, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). I will soon be joining the CS Department at City University of Hong Kong, where I will be advised by [Ziye Ma](https://gavenma.github.io/). I always welcome opportunities for collaboration, so please feel free to reach out at <whanzhang@outlook.com>.

Research Interests
======
My primary research interests focus on optimization theory and its applications in Large Language Models, including:
* Quantization of LLMs: Developing techniques to reduce the computational and memory footprint of large models.
* Zeroth-Order Optimization: Investigating methods for optimizing LLMs without explicit gradient information.
* Mitigating LLM Hallucinations: Exploring novel frameworks and loss functions to reduce the generation of factually incorrect or nonsensical information.


Hobbies : )
======
I like listening to music, watching movies, and working out.
